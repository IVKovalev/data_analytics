## Project:
# Event Analysis and A/A/B Testing

## Objectives:
To build and analyse a sales funnel to determine the user journey within a mobile application for a food product startup. Identify how many users fail to complete a purchase and at which steps they drop off.
Investigate the results of an A/A/B experiment aimed at determining the impact of new fonts on user behaviour. Determine whether the new font provides advantages over the old one in terms of positively influencing user behaviour.

## What was done:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis were conducted;
- A user action funnel was identified, and conclusions and recommendations were formulated;
- An A/A experiment was performed to verify the correctness of group splitting;
- A/B and A/A/B tests were conducted to test hypotheses regarding statistically significant differences in transition rates between groups;
- The Bonferroni correction was applied to reduce the probability of false positives in multiple testing;
- Recommendations were provided based on the test results.

## Tools/Libraries:
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	Numpy
•	Matplotlib
•	scipy.stats
